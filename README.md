# Predicting Customer Churn in Telecom
Previously, I finished the [EDA - Customer Churn in Telcom](https://github.com/yuki04160/EDA-Customer-Churn-in-Telecom) and in this repository, I will build a logistic regression and a decision tree in R to predict customer churn, giving recommendations to a Telecom company based on analysis results.
## Introduction
Customer churn is defined as the loss of clients. In a telecommunications company, customer attrition is one of the key business metrics. To be more specific, it is important to retain an existing customer since compared with newly recruited clients, the long-term relationship customers are more valuable to the company. Thus, this project aims to use customer churn analysis to forecast the behavior of telecom customers who are more likely to leave, and provide a reasonable churn prediction for customer retention marketing programs.
